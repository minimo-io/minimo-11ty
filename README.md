# ToDo

* Think about implementing esbuild to bundle javascript, [Bundle JavaScript with Eleventy and esbuild](https://blog.r0b.io/post/bundle-javascript-with-eleventy-and-esbuild/). This will need changing the currect pipeline (for the better). Check [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild).
* Markup blog files shoud be... well more markup, separated from the html. For this I will have to standarize layouts more, or have multiple-options. Also solve the full width image implementation, in "thin" wrappers.
