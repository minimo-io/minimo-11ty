        ‚ù§Ô∏è LoveInABox is a cooking app where you will be able to discover new recipes and (above all) order a cute little box with the exact ingredients to cook them.
    </p>
    <p>Its mantra is: "Express your love for your friends and loved ones üòª All while we guide you in the process."</p>
    <p>
        You will even be able to add some extras to the order such as flowers for the table or a delicious wine.
    </p>
    <p>
        The box will include the history of the recipe, the step by step and also a profile of the cook! You can follow them through the application and collaborate with them by giving them tips ‚ù§Ô∏è
