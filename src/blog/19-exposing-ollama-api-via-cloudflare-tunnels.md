### Intro.

So 2025, it's time to commit to some serious dev work.
**Let this be the pledge that holds me accountable.**

So, what can you expect from me?
Three main projects to be launched or upgraded, one learning path, some side tasks and a one weird experiment.

<center><h3>Nitty Gritties for this year</h3></center>

- **(1st) [ViiVPay](https://viivpay.com)**: Create v1 of this high (and low) risk payment processor, with PIX & Boleto for Brazil & Bitcoin/Lightning for settlements & international payments (in a near future), while keeping the project compliant in messy Third World systems, & safe from as\*?les.
- **(2nd) [Braaay.com](https://braaay.com)**: My way to elevate the game is to contribute technology, plus a lot of deep transcendental breathing, with sparse [bike rides](/biking/). Goals:

    1. Switch the front-end for [braaay.com](https://braaay.com) to a clean and lean Svelte + Tailwind.
    2. Integrate payments (including OpenNode for BTC payments).
    3. Create a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) mobile app for the Fidelity & Cashback Club, reusing the Sveltekit front-end from the web.
    4. Move the current Wordpress instance to a subdomain for using it as a headless CMS, connecting both fronts to the backend via GraphQL.
       I would prefer [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) as a CMS, but life is unfair, so accept the tradeoffs and move on.
    5. Create a WP/WC plugin that makes our "AI assistant" to write wine articles for the creative team.

- **(Side tasks) Minimo**:

    1. Upgrade MÃ­nimo to Eleventy 3.
    2. Add tools at `âŒ˜ T` (merge Futurewise.lat's project) & Nostr.
    3. Refresh the UI in the likes of https://allenai.org/ w/ [Tailwind 4 vibes](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4).
    4. Write a short article to explain people what the heck and why is this thing called MÃ­nimo.
    5. (The idealistic in me wants to save the whales and...) Migrate my custom design system to [Tailwind 4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4).

- **Learning Path**: Go deep on understanding Neural-Networks/DeepLearning & ML, Open-source AI models, fine-tuning & RAG implementations. While improving my [Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) & [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/minimo-io) skills. Check the complete learning path and free AI courses I'll take here (no link for now)... or not.

- **Possible Experiments**: After finishing the learning path, have fun creating one of these small experiments:
    1. Fine-tune a "wine recommendation assistant" with RAG capabilities, and deploy it using an open-source model running locally with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) via [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) . Or via [replicate.com](https://replicate.com))? Or just use [MistralAI](https://mistral.ai/) Le Plataforme? Or Deepseek cheap APIs?
       The result should be our own in-house AI wine _sommelier_, able to write articles & recommend. Like buscawine.com on steroids.
    2. Proof-of-concept anti-fraud API for financial services using AI (that we might use at ViiV in the future).
    3. Do crazy automation experiments using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and AI Agents, via [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/)?
    4. Run my own freaking node! To play around with the Bitcoin network (for future use in products).
    5. Create a Nostr & AI service account that adds values and collects zaps.

ðŸ¤– â‚¿ ðŸš€!

Code experiments are already open-sourced at Github [here](https://github.com/minimo-io), so feel free to say hi.

Bike around and be safe!
