### Intro.

This 2025, it's time to commit to some serious dev work.
**Let this be the pledge that holds me accountable.**

So, want to expect from me?
Two main projects to be launched, one learning path (AI & RAG techniques), a side task and a one weird experiment.

About the projects:

- **ViiVPay**: Co-found and create v1 of a high and low risk payment processor, w/PIX & Boleto for Brazil & Bitcoin/Lightning for settlements & payments (in a near future), while keeping the project compliant.
- **[Braaay.com](https://braaay.com)**: My way to elevante the game is to contribute with technology, plus a lot of deep transcendental breathing, with sparse [bike rides](/biking/). Goals:
    1. Switch the front-end for [braaay.com](https://braaay.com) to a clean and lean Svelte + Tailwind. Integrate payments (incuding OpenNode for BTC payments).
    2. Create a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) mobile app for the Fidelity & Cashback Club, reusing the Sveltekit front-end from the web.
    3. Move the current Wordpress instance to a subdomain for using it as a headless CMS, connecting the both fronts to the backend via GraphQL.
       I would prefer [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) as a CMS, but life's, unfair as it is sometimes, it's about tradeoffs.
- **Minimo**: Add tools & Nostr, and a face refresh in the style of https://allenai.org/.
- **Learning path**: Go deep on undestanding Neural-Networks/DeepLearning, ML, Open-source AI & RAG implementations. Whike improving my Python & [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/minimo-io) skills.
- **Possible Experiments:** After finishing the learning path, have fun creating one of these small experiments:
    1. Fine-tune a "wine recommendation assistant" with RAG capabilities, and deploy it using an open-source model running locally with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) via [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/). Or via [replicate.com](https://replicate.com/)? Or just use [MistralAI](https://mistral.ai/) Le Plataforme? Or Deepseek cheap APIs?
       The result should be our own in-house AI wine _sommelier_, able to write articles & recommend. Like buscawine.com on steroids.
    2. Proof-of-concept anti-fraud API for financial services using AI (that we might use at ViiV in the future).
    3. Do crazy automation experiments using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and AI Agents, via [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/)?
    4. Run my own freaking node! To play around with the Bitcoin network (for future use in products).
    5. Create a Nostr & AI service account that adds values and collects zaps.

ðŸ¤– â‚¿ ðŸš€!

Code experiments are already open-sourced at Github [here](https://github.com/minimo-io), so feel free to say hi.

Bike around and be safe!
