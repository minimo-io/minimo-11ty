Last week was the **De{code} 2024** Wordpress Developer Conference by WP-Engine, and among AI (of course), Headless Wordpress was a hot topic.

Here at Mínimo new projects are approeaching (Fintech?) so I decided it was time to hear more about this headless thing.

Some of the Headless techs reviews at the conference were.
[Atlas](https://wpengine.com/headless-wordpress/) → Wp-Engine Headless platform.

[Faust.js](https://faustjs.org/) a framework for building headless Wordpress. More in-depth? Faustjs let's you server-side render your headless page with Wordpress data outside of the template hierarchy using Next.js.
So React. So, not an option for me.

So, as an Svelte & 11ty fanboy I had to look for other options.

There's also [DecapCMS](https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms), A CMS for static site generators previously known as Netlify CMS.
