    <p>In 2024 I am pivoting my stack.</p>
    <p>
        Moving from back to the web, from Dart to Nodejs and Express, from Flutter to Svelte. From heavy CMSs to the jamstack lolz of Eleventy. Reasons in a future, more philosophical, probably non-sensical article.
    </p>
    <p>
        So first and foremost some quick (always changing) definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong class="font-weight-600">What is Vite?</strong>: A (rollup based) front-end build tool (aka bundler) and development server designed for modernnnnnnn-ous webdev.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong class="font-weight-600">What is Svelte? And SvelteKit?</strong>: Definitions are changing around. But as far as Svelte4 was concern, Svelte was a components framework, and SvelteKit an app framework. 
    </p>
    <p>Meaning that if what you need is to inject some simple functioanlity to a page (let's say one created an Static Site Generator like Eleventy) then Svelte + Vite is for you (that's the case for MÃ­nimo).</p>
    <p>If on the other hand if what you need is to build a full-fledge applicationthen SvelteKit is the way to go. More on this in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7n17ajJpCo">this video</a> about Svelte 5 with Rich Harris</p>
    <p>
        Got it! So what else would do I need? A CSS Framework.
