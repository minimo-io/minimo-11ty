## Why "why mínimo"?

What's the minimal, more optimal way, to reach the maximum possible result?
What is the minimum to get the max result?

Work, life, things, (to carry in a bag or a bike in an adventure).

A sort of life philosophy about material life.

In work, marks the path, for my interest: performance. <br>
And performant technologies, Rust, Svelte & 11ty. Pre-Compiled, optimized code! vs. Vue, React, etc.

Life:

Things:

Adventure:
