    <p>
        jQuery-codex is a plugin for sodomizing strings of text. In newer versions there are several effects available. You can see the code examples on its <a href="https://github.com/minimo-io/jquery-codex">Github page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The original idea for the first effect came from a CCC page that I couldn’t find again. So I code it myself. Many improvements are missing. Code them and share them via pull request!

        These are the examples of how to use the jQuery Codex to achieve completely and absolutely unproductive text effects.
