It is a fair goal in life to move around light: a handful of clothes, a lightning wallet, a plastic card, some cheap laptop, and a bag.

It's useful to wander around attached to a minimum of stuff—and of noise. It's useful to live a social life outside the rat wheel of impressing friends and foes. And it is particularly useful when doing knowledge work, like coding, sticking our businesses to the terminal.

To only need a couple of SSH tunnels, [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) multiplexing and NeoVim to get, literally, everywhere.

Craving a heavy GUI IDE is like living life for showing external signs of success. Silly business.

Like building muscle to look strong instead of being strong, capable of things.
Like looking successful instead of focusing on generating wealth, capable of hodling some Bitcoin and buying your own time & freedom.

Avoiding fancy, heavy tools is a goal of this wandering man.
Initially, the idea took me from VSCode to Rust-coded tools like [Zed](https://zed.dev/), from the macOS Terminal to [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/).

Previous years have thrown me into the claws of Eleventy, from there to Svelte, then to ...Kit, then to Svelte 5, then to Tailwind.

Eventually, the whole thing made me think it's time to move away from my comfortable multi-window terminal emulator to more advanced ways to complicate my craving for a minimalistic developer life—while feeling good about it.

It is time, then, for some multiplexing experiments. It's time to finally learn how to exit NeoVim.

And what better way to start than with some experiments in local espionage?

Because at the beginning, there must always be fun.

So here we go.
