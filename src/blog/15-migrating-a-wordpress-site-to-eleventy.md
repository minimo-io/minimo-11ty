title: Migrating a +800 pages Wordpress site to Eleventy
draft: true
---

### The scenario

The site has 3 different languages, and 809 pages total.
3 languages, pt-br, es, and en.

ðŸ‘‡
508 urls for games reviews.

43 blog articles.
<br>
21 pages.
<br>
126 casino reviews.
<br>
28 categories.
<br>
83 game provider pages
<br>
**= 809 pages.**

### Idea

The idea was to progresively migrate pages one by one.
Ideally making some tests with low traffic and authority pages and them slowly move high traffic pages one by one.

### Steps

1. Backup the Digital Ocean wordpress site.
2. Use httrack website copier to backup betizen.org as a static site.
