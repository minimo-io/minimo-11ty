    <p>
        LightningBeer is as a proof-of-concept app for those willing to use bitcoin as money, so they (we!) can buy our craft beers using satoshis. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Beers will be delivered by 3rd party #bitcoin friendly retail stores. I am closing a deal with Braaay.com from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
    </p>
    <p>
        The financial goal for the project will be to cover its operational costs. 
        Expect an open financial report once a month.    
    </p>
    <p>
    I am open to ideas on how to allow support for the project (extra cost for the service? Sponsored beers or stores?)
