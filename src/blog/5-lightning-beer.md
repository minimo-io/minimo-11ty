    <p>
        LightningBeer is as a proof-of-concept app for those of us willing to use bitcoin as money, not just as one more speculative asset, so we can buy our craft 6-packs using satoshis, instead of just sitting above them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beers will be delivered by 3rd party #bitcoin friendly retail stores. I am closing a deal with <a href="">Braaay.com</a> from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
    </p>
    <p>
        The financial goal for the project will be to cover its operational costs. 
        Expect an open financial report once a month. <u>Partners are welcome!</u>
