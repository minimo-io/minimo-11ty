    <p>Ok so, results first. There you go ⬆️ You're free to go back now to your scrolling habits.</p>
    <h2 class="h4 font-italic">TL;DR</h2>
    <p>Thing is that I have some little project called <a href="/work/betizen/">Betizen.org</a></p>

    <p>
        This project <a href="https://betizen.org">lists online casinos, games & bonuses</a>. From that I make a buck (or try to) as an affiliate. Crazy industry, nice bunch. Have done side-affiliate-projects for about 7 years. Have made bucks and spent bucks, succeded and failed, have traveled and been forced to travel for months.
    </p>
    <p>I do not offer anything, nor actively reach operators. But from time to time some good affiliate manager finds the site, contacts me and make a offer. So I list them. For a buck, so to make one.</p>
    
    <p>If settle an agreement, we need to agree on a medium of exchange. Sometimes we disagree. If we do not, I propose Bitcoin via mainnet of <a href="/blog/bitcoin-and-the-lightning-network/">Lightning</a> for spares, as they are the best I know for cross border transactions, but I am usually also open for ERC-20. Say Circle’s (USDC), say Tether (USDT)</p>
