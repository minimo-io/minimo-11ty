<div class="wrapper text-justify mt-5">
    <h1>It's Huge!</h1>
    <h2 class="font-italic">The Lightning Network</h2>
    <h2 class="h4">This is yet another standard "container", or wrapper.</h2>
    <p class="fs-400">Now let's imagine a text, like the profile one, that needs to be a litte bigger.
        Even as a paragraph. Here is the .fs-400 class.
    </p>
    <p>Oh by the way, <a href="/archive/">Here is our archive!</a></p>
    <p>Meant to be very simple to use!</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="/images/cool-image.jpg" alt="Some cool image" class="img-rounded">
        <figcaption>A caption for the above image</figcaption> 
    </figure>
    <p>
        And as you might... wait, here some <code>window.onload</code>, see this one should be able to hold text the size of our main container max width variable... 
        We cannot say the same for everybody else around here... kkk. But fair enough, is this working or not?
    </p>
    <p>For <strong>all of them</strong> we need to solve their paddings!</p>
    <p>And <strong>after that, the font-sizes</strong>.</p>
    <p>So, solve:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>General paddings (except for profile).</li>
        <li>General font sizes (clamps?).</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <pre>
        <code>
const primaryNav = document.querySelector(".nav");
const navToggle = document.querySelector(".nav-toggle");
const profileImage = document.querySelector(".img-profile");</code>
    </pre>

        This is some made out texxxxt, and i am re-learning css for the moment.
        But belive it or not, this is a Jekyll project!

        And so here we will have more and more text, just stupid nonsense, nothing worthwhile but still something
        to read.

    <figure class="full-width">
        <img src="/images/cool-image.jpg" class="img-rounded">       
        <figcaption class="text-right">Credits to SomeRandomGuyAtUnsplash</figcaption> 
    </figure>            
    <h2>Ah by the way</h2>
    <p>Almost forgot about it. By the way... <a href="/article">here is a link</a>.</p>
    <h3>And finally a sub-item</h3>
    <p>This is just a sub-item, nothing fancy!</p>
    <h4 class="mb-0">Smaller stuff coming</h4>
    <p class="mt-0">Just testing things out, to see how a real text would look like, with all its elements.</p>
    <h5>Coming to an end</h5>
    <p>This is the end, beautiful friend!</p>
    <h6>THE END</h6>
    <p>Wonder what changed? Well just another silly text trying to make the point that having 
        an H6 is somehow relevant to anything!
        
        But you know what? It is not!
    
        So chill the fu**@ up!
    </p>
