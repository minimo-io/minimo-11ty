<p>Let's promote some reciprocity here! Find out who does and who doesn't follow you back on Nostr, just to let them now ðŸ˜¹</p>

    This is a concept micro-app with the goal of having a first contact with the <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol">Nostr Protocol</a>, and trying out libraries like <a href="https://github.com/nostr-dev-kit/ndk">NDK by pablof7z</a>.
    Find <a href="https://github.com/minimo-io/appticles/tree/main/nostr-followback">the Github repo</a> for bugs and To Do lists.
